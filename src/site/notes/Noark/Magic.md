# Wild Magic

The fourth magic subtype
Wild/Forbidden Magic
These are the untamable natural magical phenomenons that happen in the world
So stuff like external darkness exposure changing your outer appearance
Or "darkness poisoning" changing your internals and warping personality
Its the observable phenomenons that happen in nature ever since the darkness integration
That's why its called "wild" magic
And the "forbidden" part is because the effects of the magic is almost always negative
So the unnatural/abominable changes that started occuring in nature are due to this
The fauna and flora that "survived" and exists in the words now is due to this too
That's why its all so fucking weird and works in such very unnatural ways 
Its kinda like the ambient magic in the world
Its not like you can't make use of it
You definitely can if you are creative enough
The main difference between wild and the rest of the three is that its "natural" magic, as opposed to "individual" magic
Okay then
So I don't think I explained this yet?
But if I had to give it a more accurate name to the fourth magic type, "Wild Magic", then I would name as "Soul Magic"
Since darkness is effectively the souls of "beings beyond the stars", mushed into an incoherent mess
So for the sake of the understanding
I'll be referring to darkness as souls in this convo
So, like I said, darkness is the incoherent mess of souls of another world
All the consciousness of these souls were combined into one large pool and thrown into a layer above hell
And there, the souls were driven mad and lost all the will that their consciousness had, and were corrupted by the flames of hell over many centuries
Then during the events of The Darkest Dawn, these were able to escape from their purgatory and were drawn to the will of the living humans of Earth
Its their centuries of torment and suffering, and the flames of hell, that corrupts living things and causes erosion of stuff
So how wild magic works, is that the caster "tunes into the rhythm" of the world and "opens his own soul" to the ambient souls in the air
Essentially opening a pathway for the ambient souls, since these lack a mind of their own and are drawn to will that is still intact
The caster can then fashion these ambient souls with his will into a desire spell and use the ambient souls he let in as fuel to cast magic
I think "opening his own soul" is pretty self-explanatory, the castor lets some ambient souls into his body and exerts his will to fashion them into spell
Now what I mean by "tune into the rhythm of the world" is pretty interesting
The souls lack a mind of their own, only some residue basic instincts
As such, you need some that is familiar to them to let them in your body
How does one do that?
By speaking their language
Since these humans all had one common tongue, and all their people were combined into one, this is the strongest familiarity you can have
So the spell casting is merely the caster speaking in their tongue about what he wants to do
How did the people of this world learn this?
Well, darkness still has some flickers of will left here and there
And these wills are mostly what the new creatures in the world are: some small sparks of will gaining a lot of souls and shaping into something familiar and simple
Anyways
The people who live close to the souls can sometimes hear the voices of these will residue, especially the people who have gone mad
And from these, the tongue of the outer beings was learned
