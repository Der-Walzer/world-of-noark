The intrinsic ability of [[Noark/Mira Mundora\|Mira Mundora]], holder of the title "The Unconquerable"

The ability "Paradise's Gate" allows Mira can manifest as a small tower falling from the sky.  
As long as she has any juice inside her, absolutely nothing can harm her.  
No secrets of the heavens can be conquered by the mortal world, after all.  
And manifesting the tower takes a heavy toll on her juice, but it quite literally stops even the concept of existence from reaching her for a short duration.  

One, the base form of Paradise Gate, that is to negate all harm done directly to Mira, is passive and always active. It also takes negligible amounts of juice out of her astronomical large pool of juice reservoir, so it can make her invincible for virtually an indefinite amount of time.  
Second, the damage that her ability negates doesn't dissipate into the ether, it gets displaced away from Mira and stockpiled. So if she ever runs out of juice somehow, then all the damage that she has accumulated throughout her life will hit her all at once.

Her ability has an effective range of 9 [[Noark/Merute\|mer]] radius and 1,017.88 [[Noark/Merute\|mer]]Â².
