So, I had been thinking about how to introduce organic architecture into the system Since there's nothing in there that would allow for that, other than some intrinsic ability Problem with that is the whole thing would collapse after the ability holder dies, which would not be ideal Tried to solve it by him leaving his ability behind as a form of relic, similar to the Thorn from the queen But that would need him to be a Governor too, which would have its own set of problems, so shot that idea down But then I was going down memory lane and remembered Muramasa Rebirth that I used to play extensively on the vita, and I got an idea Do you know about Sokushinbutsu? So I was thinking of doing that with the guy Basically, near the end of his life, he self-mummified himself and basically using his ability to retain the cells of his body in a constant state of necrosis Basically turning himself into a tool that can be blasted with darkness to isolate the erosion to hold cells in a sort of "near death" and make it work, before its cell go back to a state of constant death Thoughts?

I would say first of all you should work on the premise. You gave the data when the story changed but little else - where did this substence appear? How did it appear? How did it spread? How it affect the people? What did people do? What caused the fall of civilization? How did people try to fight\avoid the substence? Who is this Yagdrav? Where did he come from? Where did people congregate at and how if he united all of humanity left? How did he find the way to accelerate the evolution and how did this let humans save themselves? On what principals Yagdrav built his rure? Where was his capital? How he enforced his rule? Were there rebellions or another factions?

Where the substance appeared is actually the only connection this world has to my fanfic (other than Mira appearing there sometimes in the future), but cutting out the connection to explain it in terms of the universe alone:
The darkness is a "will made manifest" of an eldritch or transcendent god-like being. Its main desire is getting more power and growing stronger. It fused all consciousness of the people of its world into one and dropped them into hell, gaining power from their suffering in the murky darkness of the purgatory. The darkness itself is a form of the remnants of the people's body/consciousness and a getway into the place they were thrown in (aka hell).
It spreads like mist mostly, that is to say, through airborne means. Its also mildly miscible with every element, so it can slowly be absorbed by anything and everything (which is also how the infection/decay due to darkness is triggered)

As for how it effects people, I think I put it in there already? But basically, on a physical level, it expands everything in their body by 36%, before triggering a rapid spontaneous erosion that decays them. But for the mental level, due to the darkness being a gateway into purgatory and the chaotic swirl of immeasurable consciousness within, it wears down their sanity and drives them mad. This part is actually independent of whether they are infected by the darkness or not, as mere proximity to it can trigger these mental effects, with the severity depending on the amount of the darkness.
This is actually the cause of the months of dimming, as the reporters that arrived back at the scene carried back darkness into the printing presses and contaminated the place, with the newspapers carrying small doses of darkness everywhere, slowly tering down the general population's sanity
People really didn't do anything until it was too late, since they couldn't figure out why these insane things were happening. A repeat of the black plague occurs until they figure out the source.
Downfall of civilization is caused by most of humanity dying off and most areas becoming too contaminated to live in
How they tried to avoid it was, like I said, basically a repeat of the black plague, mixed in with a bit of the Corona virus situation mixed in lol.
They also had a big science team trying to find a cure to the darkness, one of which was actually Yagdrav
He was a surgeon and physician who tried to save the people suffering from the decay, but due to failing and seeing one too many people die, left that field and joined the team to look for the cure instead

People would congregate at areas that were relatively safe at the start, until they discovered that the area that the darkness first appeared is somehow free of the darkness infection, so that's where the people working on the cure and most of the important remaining people were sent
Also where remaining humanity united after being transformed

As for how he found a way to save accelerate evolution, getting his will to save the suffering people directly after a certain event and conquering his personal demons allowed him to "see" Conquest at the safe zone (the reason why the infection didn't spread where the darkness appeared) and make a wish, basically
Which is what evolved humans
Think I have that down in the Conquest section of the doc already?
The capital itself is in France, as that's where the solar eclipse of 1875 appeared
Would need to do some calculations and shit to find the exact location of where in France is the capital tho

Looking at this, plus the phrase pseudo-magic floating suddenly in my head, gave me the idea for dividing the magic of Noark into three layers

- Innate Abilities,
- Relics,
- Pseudo-magic,

Very on the nose names, I know, but they are placeholders Anyway, quickly giving a rundown Innate Abilities are "pure magic" so to speak Highly personal, only wielded by a specific group, limit of one per person (for the most part) Relics are basically "preserved magic" Some of the innate abilities can do magic that can repeat itself/work in a perpetual cycle under certain conditions outside of the original instance of being casted The Artchitect is the biggest (and only) example I got of this Last one is pseudo-magic An even more "watered down version" Relic Only benefit of which is being able to be used by the average joe So, an example of this is something I have had in the story (like, the og story outside of Noark) for a long but didn't connect There's a character that goes to fight Mira with a weapon that leeches mana Said weapon is a cursed katana The katana itself is created from a thorn, that needs to be "feed" fresh blood to keep it working So if you don't douse it with blood semi-frequently, the blade it produces will become dull and lose their effect The character in question embedded the thorn between inside their body, specifically through their liver and spine, to always keep it fed with their own blood Anyway, the thorn is a Relic But the katana is a pseudo-magic Anyone can pick it up and use the same leeching effect And it will work the same for anyone, not just the person who created them In addition, we also have non-magical ""magical"" items in this section So something like the image above would be classified as pseudo-magic.

Okay, a fourth magic subtype
Wild/Forbidden Magic
These are the untamable natural magical phenomenons that happen in the world
So stuff like external darkness exposure changing your outer appearance
Or "darkness poisoning" changing your internals and warping personality
Its the observable phenomenons that happen in nature ever since the darkness integration
That's why its called "wild" magic
And the "forbidden" part is because the effects of the magic is almost always negative
So the unnatural/abominable changes that started occuring in nature are due to this
The fauna and flora that "survived" and exists in the words now is due to this too
That's why its all so fucking weird and works in such very unnatural ways 
Its kinda like the ambient magic in the world
Its not like you can't make use of it
You definitely can if you are creative enough
The main difference between wild and the rest of the three is that its "natural" magic, as opposed to "individual" magic

Himmel = Heaven/Sky

I propose the following model:

> Each Darkness Heir produces an unconscious _frequency_ — a metaphysical vibration tied to the darkness within their second heart. These frequencies naturally repel one another, creating instability and violent reaction (the reason Heirs cannot coexist peacefully).
> 
> Mira’s frequency is _infinitely broad_. Instead of repelling, it absorbs and harmonizes all frequencies around her — nullifying conflict, stabilizing fields, and, by extension, silencing decay.

Effectively, she is the first **stable singularity of darkness** ever observed.
