Here are some of the basic powers and relics that the Darkness Heirs inherit when they become a Darkness Governor:

# Ring of Command: 

A ring that resides within the first heart of the Governor of Darkness. The ring chooses the heir of the position of Governor. Stabilizes the destructive intrinsic abilities of the Governor. Each intrinsic ability of the Governor is inscribed in the ring and is inherited by the heir, the effectiveness depending on the compatibility of the personalities of the heir with their predecessors.

The Ring of Command also keeps a Record of all the [[Noark/Darkness Governors Lineage\|Governors]] and their [[Noark/Governor's Abilities\|abilities.]]  
But the strength of their powers depends on the compatibility they have with the personality of the previous heir that they are borrowing the power from, and the effectiveness of the power also depends on a few other factors, like how well it meshes with their powers and skillets.  
Interesting bit is that when a heir is chosen, they get memories of the previous heir they are most compatible with, and they act as a sort of "guardian angel" mentor to them.

# Hand of Conjuror: 

A giant claw that allows the use of the intrinsic magic of the predecessors and an enhancer to one's own magic. Takes the shape of a giant metallic claw. Grows stronger and more potent with each use.

# Heart of Conqueror: 

The larger second heart that is just beneath the first one. It breathes the dark ichor of the darkness through the body, enhancing the heir's capabilities, latent potential and strengths. However, it slowly kills the qualities of the blood of the first heart, and even though it can never fully kill it, it can make it eternally dormant in a state of complete necrosis. The second heart of the potential heirs is larger than those who don't qualify for the position.
