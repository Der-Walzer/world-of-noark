Its the same as normal earth history, up until 1875

**Tuesday 6th April, 1875:**  
_The Darkest Dawn_

A completely black, mist-like substance started spreading around the world following the total solar eclipse on this day, enshrouding 86% of the world in the wake of its destruction.  
By the time Yagdrav (who becomes the first Darkness Governor after saving humanity and the world) saved humanity and the world from extinction by forcing the remaining alive humans to undergo millenniums worth of evolution in a single instant to merge them with the darkness, we are already set back to 1305 in terms of human advancement.  
After a three decade rule, there's a power vacuum following Yagdrav's death.  
And a surplus of Darkness Heirs due to the sudden prosperity of "humanity".  
Leading us to the 143 year long period of complete turmoil and wars.  
This is the period where Crimson Queen comes into power in the 98th year, extending the war by another 45 years.  
Then another couple of decades of power imbalance following her death.  
Then we get to the reign of The Priest.  
And this is when things begin to kinda settle in and become stable.  
This tradition still carries on till the era of Mira's rule.
