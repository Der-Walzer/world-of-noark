So, I had been thinking about how to introduce organic architecture into the system
Since there's nothing in there that would allow for that, other than some intrinsic ability
Problem with that is the whole thing would collapse after the ability holder dies, which would not be ideal
Tried to solve it by him leaving his ability behind as a form of relic, similar to the Thorn from the queen
But that would need him to be a Governor too, which would have its own set of problems, so shot that idea down
But then I was going down memory lane and remembered Muramasa Rebirth that I used to play extensively on the vita, and I got an idea
Do you know about Sokushinbutsu?
So I was thinking of doing that with the guy
Basically, near the end of his life, he self-mummified himself and basically using his ability to retain the cells of his body in a constant state of necrosis
Basically turning himself into a tool that can be blasted with darkness to isolate the erosion to hold cells in a sort of "near death" and make it work, before its cell go back to a state of constant death
Thoughts?
