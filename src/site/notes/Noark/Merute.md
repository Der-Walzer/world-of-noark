The official standard unit of measurement: Merute.

The reason that 1 merute - the unit of measurement - is exactly 1.36 meters, is because it wasn't always a unit for measuring distance, but started as a unit for measuring the degree of corruption caused by darkness (which I am having be a viscous, fine-mist like substance that's almost pitch black with a heavy purple tint).  
Kinda like how we measure radiation levels with becquerel.  
Darkness caused things it corrupted to expand by 36% before the deterioration process started. After which, the object expands and becomes porous, and also gains a little black + heavy purple tint.  
But after everything got infused with darkness, it became a unit of measurement.  
So merute is just meter, but with the zero correction of 36% applied to get accurate measurements.
