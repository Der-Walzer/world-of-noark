Secured chambers where corpses are all dumped so that they can decay and their darkness can return to the realm without much issue.

When all the dark beings die, they decay into darkness, which can harmfully affect the other darkness beings due to the flux of raw darkness raising the circulation of their own dark ichor involuntarily.

There are five decay chambers in Noark.

Niemheim: People who die realively young
Blutfriedhof: Criminals
Wiegeschwachen: Elderly and natural death
Aschengarten: Stillborns
Nihilo Oubliette: Darkness Heirs and Governors

**M체rbst채tte** = m체rbe (Soft) St채tte (place/site)

# Aschengarten

A small room where stillborn are all put to decay peacefully. About 2187.96 mer^2 in area, this decay chamber lies on the edge of the innermost rim. It was originally a garden before the [[Noark/World's Timeline#*The Morning of Ashes*\|The Morning Ashes]] incident, where it was made into a Decay Chamber and given the name Aschengarten, a combination of Aschen (Ashes) and Kindergarten.
Interestingly enough, flowers can survive in this chamber, and spider lily naturally grow there. These are actually the dead children. Since darkness can manifest as other living creatures, and since the small sparks of their consciousness only know of the flowers offered to death children, they just assume their form.
Aschen = Ashes, Garten (from Kindergarten) = Garden ("Garden of children's ashes")




# Nihilo Oubliette

Nihilo Oubliette is a small room underground the main palace where the darkness heirs and governors are buried. The darkness in this area is actually harmless, so even normal people can visit it without any reprecussions. Every Governor also has a dedicated grave in this area with their "ashes" in urns, since unlike everyone else, the corpses of Darkness Governors don't decay as long as the ring is inside them. Once the ring is removed, their body will turn to black mist of darkness, which is what's stored in urns.

The reason being that, like I said before, everyone else who dies has their soul inside the darkness emission that is emitted when their corpse decays. However, the souls of darkness heirs has high resistance to being assimilated by the darkness or becomes a physical phenomenon, and the souls of the darkness governors is immediately carried to the limbo of The Knowledge
As such, their darkness residue doesn't have the soul fuel powering the corruption
Nihilo = Nothing, Oubliette = Dungeon ("The Dungeon of Nothing")
