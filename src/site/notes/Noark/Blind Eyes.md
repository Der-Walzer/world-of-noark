The evolved versions of Blind Sentinels, controlled by Insatiable Mira.

Insatiable Mira control over the darkness allows her abuse the mental link developed between the Blind Sentinels and the Governor who enthralled them, to pump so much darkness into the Sentinels that their brain melts from all the excess of darkness, turning them into husks. She can then control the darkness slush inside their brains that imparts a reductive copy of their original personality and override that to turn them into truly empty husks, which she can use as a sort proxy drones.

Because of this. they are called "Blind Eyes of the Queen" or just "Blind Eyes"
