The original holder of Blood Puppetry "The Puppeteer" had, in addition to this ability, a very high tolerance to darkness, allowing her to draw out more of the power of the Heart of Conquest without losing control.

This ability allowed him to give any darkness being a sliver of her power (more resistance to darkness, thus allowing them to use more of their second heart to gain more strength) by sealing off all their sensory organs (eyes, mouths, ears, nose) and clipping the nerve endings of their bodies that felt pain, making them have more pain tolerance.

There were many who desired power, or wished to serve the the Governor or the country as she came before the The Anointed, and thus the world was at war.

The thralls are called "Blind Sentinels" because they are blind in every way and only serve the ability user by following the commands given to them via the mental link they all develop with the Governor.

Insatiable Mira's attunement to darkness allowed this ability to gain more potential, allowing her to turn the Blind Sentinels into the [[Noark/Blind Eyes\|Blind Eyes]].
