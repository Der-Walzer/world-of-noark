Birthed by an [[Hierachies\|Epilictic]] mother, Mira was a stillborn. Due to her status as a stillbirth, she was dumped to decay in [[Noark/Decay Chambers\|Aschengarten]].

At the time, they didn't know that she was a Darkness Heir candidate. She had [[Noark/Paradise's Gate\|Paradise's Gate]], an ability that was on par with [[Noark/Conquest\|Conquest]], not just in the ability's raw capability, but also in its nature being closer to the divine as compared to the more earthly nature of all other Darkness Heir abilities.

Nine days after the events, there was another stillbirth in the hospital. When a [[TK!Mira's foster father\|certain]] [[Noark/Corpse Disposers\|corpse disposer]] was carrying the stillborn to lay it to rest in , he heard crying. When he looked inside in confusion to see what's happening, he's shocked to see that not only Mira hasn't decayed, she is the one crying.

He immediately realized that she must be a Darkness Heir, and had some kind of ability that not allowed her to somehow stay alive despite being a stillborn, but also go nine days without any food, water or any sustenance of any kind. 

And because of this, she's given the title of Mira, The Unconquerable. 

She became the Darkness Governor and inherited the [[Noark/Darkness Governor's Artifacts\|Governor Artifacts]] that every Darkness Heir inherits upon becoming a [[Noark/Darkness Governor\|Darkness Governor]].

There are two variations of Mira, depending on whether or not she succumbs to the darkness during the first nine days she spent in Aschengarten.

# The Unconquerable

The Mira that never succumbed to the madness induced by the darkness in the decay chamber. However, it left her highly vulnerable/attunement to the hivemind of the darkness, hearing indistinct muttering and chanting of the souls fused with the darkness in her sleep.

# The Insatiable 

The Mira that succumbed to the madness induced by the darkness in the decay chamber. With Paradise Gate protecting her mind from the corruption of the darkness, it made her the only soul within the darkness hivemind with an individuality, leading her to have complete control over the darkness. 


Intense subconscious trauma of the collective voices of all the stillborn and other voices in her head, the first thing Unconquerable Mira ever heard being their broken whispers.  
Though just whispers she hears in the twilight stage between sleep and consciousness, since only the Insatiable is tuned into the darkness.

# Character Sheet

Both version of Mira possess the same desire: To belong somewhere.

Due to her status, Mira is treated as an idol or symbol, a living legend but not a person. Not dead yet not alive; not divine yet not mortal; not belonging to the world yet controlling its follow; not a peasant yet not a noble. 

Most don't even no her name as they only call her as Mira The Unconquerable, usually even forgoing her first name and just calling her The Unconquerable.

Unconquerable Mira essentially silences her self and embraces the role of an icon, going along the flow of life.

Unconquerable like an impenetrable fortress, yet also stagnant and embedded in one place like one too.

Insatiable Mira burns and tears through everything, killing that which refuses to bend and ruling the rest through fear, all in an attempt to mold the world into one where she might belong. But the world still never feels like it accepts her no matter.

Insatiable like the bottomless chasm of purgatory, one that will never come to know true fulfillment.

Both versions of Mira desire to be deemed worthy by [[Noark/Conquest\|Conquest]], as it judges people on the worth of their souls, yet it never acknowledges them as worthy to use it.

For Unconquerable Mira, its because she has given up her own agency, not possessing the burning conviction to walk against the flow of life twice as fast, instead letting herself be drift by its flow.

For Insatiable Mira, its because she doesn't possess the willpower to face her own inner demon, lashing out at the world instead. She doesn't possess to truly rule the people.

As Mira is considered the strongest Darkness Heir, everyone expects her to be able to use it eventually. As such, Mira feels she will finally reach acceptance by the world if she is acknowledged by it.

Considering that there was no magic in the world when the Darkness came, meant that anyone couldâ€™ve used Conquest, not just the original Darkness Heir.  
But there's only one manifestation, like a one time-use crystal  
This can somewhat explain why only Yagdrav was able to use it

The Nameless's power is destruction of the self for more power, creating a hive mind that increases power being his whole thing.  
Basically the opposite of Mono's law  
That's what the second heart does too btw. It poisons and kills the first heart overtime with each use. Granting more power, but killing your humanity bit by bit  
It's why Corpse Disposers have an outwardly monstrous appearance, due to dealing with excess waste darkness for a very long time

The ones who are fully taken over by the darkness also become part of a hive mind  
Like an amalgamation of minds that everyone who is exposed to too much darkness can feel and can be sucked into  
The Insatiable could control it, and why The Unconquerable can't in any meaningful way  
The Corpse disposal workers are also just part of the hivemind  
Because they didn't abuse their second heart and only got exposed to excess darkness externally, most of the corpse disposers first became schizophrenic, before mentally killed and taken over completely, living and doing their duties in a mental fugue.  
But the end result is darkness slushie in their skulls  
Since the one who discovered Mira is a rather upstanding and good person, with a very strong moral compass, he was able to resist being turned into brain goo because of his "very strong moral compass" and shit.



Side Note: Blood Queen is In!Mira's Guardian, while The Father is Un!Mira's Guardian
So In!Mira has a lot of affinity with Blood Bending, while Un!Mira has a lot of affinity with Healing
