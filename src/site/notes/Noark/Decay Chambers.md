Secured chambers where corpses are all dumped so that they can decay and their darkness can return to the realm without much issue.

When all the dark beings die, they decay into darkness, which can harmfully affect the other darkness beings due to the flux of raw darkness raising the circulation of their own dark ichor involuntarily.

There are four decay chambers in Noark.

# Aschengarten

A small room where stillborn are all put to decay peacefully. About 2187.96 mer^2 in area, this decay chamber lies on the edge of the innermost rim. It was originally a garden before the [[Noark/World's Timeline#*The Morning of Ashes*\|The Morning Ashes]] incident, where it was made into a Decay Chamber and given the name Aschengarten, a combination of Aschen (Ashes) and Kindergarten.
