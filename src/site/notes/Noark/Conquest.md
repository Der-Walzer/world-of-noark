The ability granted to [[Noark/Yagdrav Dunkelheit\|Yagdrav Dunkelheit]], holder of the title "The Liberator"

Conquest is a manifestation of the [[RoFT World/Law of Conquest\|Law of Conquest]].  
Because the whole thing was just an experiment by Nameless cuz bro was bored  
And FA saw it and said, "Fuck it, we ball"
The ability of the first darkness heir was "Conquest" (I originally named it The Greater Will because of what it does)  
Its a conceptual manipulation power like Mira's Paradise Gate  
Basically, its a wish granting power, with no secret drawbacks or consequences to the wishes.  
But, its a sentient ability, and grants wishes by judging the worth of your soul.  
So, any heir can access this ability, since even a little bit of affinity is enough to use the power at full scale.  
And despite that, the conditions for getting it to work are so high, no one other than the first darkness heir used it.  
I called it Greater Will before because of how it works, but I feel that doesn't convey just how much you need to overcome and "conquer" to use it even once.  
Not even Mira for all her potential and power, was deemed worthy by the ability (as despite fulfilling all the other conditions, she didn't fulfill one of them. Not only walking with the flow of life, but walking backwards against the flow of life twice as fast. But Mira has accepted the emotional and psychological distance between her and everyone due to not being seen as the person Mira, but as the untouchable icon of domination, Mira the Unconquerable. So she has become emotionally stunted and lost the capacity to feel due to both her isolating ability and position, and feels no desire to do anything. As such, she has become complacent to just keep up the status quo and just go along with life instead of fighting against everything in life with every last bit of her will to get what she desires. She is like an unconquerable fortress. It may be impenetrable, but it will forever remain in the same place. As such, Conquest has not deemed her worthy yet).  
The first governor used Conquest to adapt to the darkness that was slowly engulfing the world and destroying it, and as such Conquest forced multitudes of evolutions and turned them into darkness beings. Hence their human appearances, double hearts and not being completely fine in too much excess darkness.
